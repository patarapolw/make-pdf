# Creating PDF's from markdown

With features that markdown normally won't have.

## Page breaks

Page breaks are possible via merging multiple PDF's.

### Hello `Hopding/pdf-lib`

This is all possible because of <https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib>.

![pdf-lib logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hopding/pdf-lib-docs/master/assets/logo-full.svg?sanitize=true =300x*)

So, all Node.js dependencies. No [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) (binary) or [pdfbox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) (Java) for now.

One of the three is required to merge PDF files.

## Local images and assets
